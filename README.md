# fremontbridgebikecrossinng

Hello! 

So just looking at some bike crossings of the fremont bridge, nothing super official or fancy
But wanted to look at how Covid-19 and the lockdown affected bike traffic through fremont 

Um it's all in R and it pulls data right from the Seattle data api (https://data.seattle.gov) 

There are a couple different tangents going on, but the end results compares ridership by day in 2019 to 2020. With actual daily counts as well as the trendlines.

A few things that I took away from this are:
  1. More people commuted into seattle in 2020 than out of seattle via bike (spoiler alert)
  2. The lockdown correlates to a drastic decrease in daily bikers (2nd spoiler alert)
  3. The number of bikers is not going up or down and has been pretty constant throughout summer (A little more interesting) 
  
  
Next steps would be to:
  1. Examine how the recent string of fires has affected ridership (or maybe how much, it has affected ridership) 
  2. Look more into historical records about hourly ridership
  3. See how it changes by season (are commutes at all similar to the sunrise/sunset)
  4. Has the ratio of commuters changed in the past decade

    
    
Thanks, hope it's interesting and/or informative
